This folder contains several jupyter notebooks that walk users through the details of how to fit different models with the glmhmm package. All of these examples use simulated data for illustration purposes and to help users understand the basics of GLMs, HMMs, and GLM-HMMs. 

If you want some more specific tutorials on how to fit these models to real data, check out the <code>figures</code> folder. The notebooks in that folder recreate all the plots associated with the modeling results in the paper [Bolkan, Stone et al 2021](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.23.453573v1) and provide a useful starting point for users who might want to run similar analyses on their own data.
